## QuizApplication
This is a web application with the help of spring boot. It is a  Quiz Application where users are presented with a series of questions. Based on their responses, the application calculates how many questions they answered correctly, and the user is awarded a corresponding score. The final score reflects the number of correct answers, providing immediate feedback on their performance.

### Database
We are using **PostgreSQL** as the database for this Quiz Application to store and manage the data.


### API Testing with Postman
Since we are not using a frontend for this project, we are using **Postman** to test the API functionality. Postman allows us to simulate API requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and view the responses directly.

###Creating a project
Go to [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) and create a Spring boot project. here I'm using Intellij community version IDE and pgAdming$ as DataBase.
